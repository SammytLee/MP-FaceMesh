# MP-FaceMesh
## Introduction
This is a project in using a Face Mesh through mediapipe. It shows how a face mesh can be used and its capabailities on v
ideos founds from pexel. The videos are all open source.

## Technology
* Python 3.9
* Mediapipe 0.8.5
* OpenCV-Python 4.5.2.54
* numpy 1.20.3

## Launch
Simply run the program and it should launch using the video specified in the code.

## Features
### FaceMeshBasics
This is a basic program that detects the face and shows the different facial landmarks that are used to create a Face mesh. 
It prints out the ids and where they are located on the face. There is an FPS counter that is also imposed onto the video. 
### FaceMeshModule
This program creates different modules to be called into a main program. 
It makes it such that this code can be called into any other new project easily without rewriting all the necessary components again.

## Project Status
